<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<p>
Welcome to my tutorial on how to install OsTicket. For our first step, you want to go and create a Windows 10 Virtual Machine using Microsoft Azure. We're using a virtual machine to make sure that we protect our own machine incase any problems arise. To start create a resource group and a virtual machine of Windows 10 that uses the resource group that we just created.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Okay great! Now we‚Äôll connect to our virtual machine (vn) using its public IPv4 Address in Microsoft Remote Desktop (RDP) if you are on Mac you can do so by downloading Microsoft Remote Desktop.
</p>
<br />

</p>

<p>
Once you are connected to your VM you must enable IIS. To do so, we‚Äôll go to our control panel using our windows start menu and typing in ‚Äúcontrol panel‚Äù from here select ‚Äúuninstall a program‚Äù then ‚Äúturn windows features on or off‚Äù. Enable Internet Information Systems >> World Wide Web Services >> Application Development Features >> CGI box
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>

<p>
Next download and install the following files, PHP Manager for IIS (PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0.msi) and Rewrite Module (rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi)
</p>

</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Afterwards we will create the directory C:\PHP by going into our local disk and creating a folder called ‚ÄúPHP‚Äù.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Once you have done this step we can download PHP 7.3.8 (php-7.3.8-nts-Win32-VC15-x86.zip) and unzip the contents into C:\PHP
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Next we download download and install VC_redist.x86.exe, then download and install MySQL 5.5.62 (mysql-5.5.62-win32.msi).
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Follow these steps when installing MySQL 5.5.62
Step 1: Typical Setup
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
Step 2: Launch Configuration Wizard after installation <br />
Step 3: Standard Configuration
<p>

</p>
Step 4: Password1
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Note that the User is ‚Äúroot‚Äù and the password can be anything you want it to be as long as you remember it because this is crucial for the future steps.
</p>
<br />

<p>
Next we will open IIS as an Admin and register PHP from within IIS by double clicking on ‚ÄúPHP Manager‚Äù and selecting ‚Äú Register new PHP Version.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
From here we go to C:\PHP and select php-cgi, then open. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Great! We have now registered a new PHP version. Now we reload IIS by opening IIS, clicking stop and start.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Okay now we can download osTicket. Once downloaded extract the zip file and copy the upload folder to the following path:  c:\inetpub\wwwroot
After doing so, rename the upload folder to osTicket 
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
For our next step we will open IIS Manager and restart the server by selecting stop and then start. In IIS Manager select the following: Sites >> Default >> osTicket then click on ‚ÄúBrowse*.80‚Äù which should be located to the right. The osTicket web server should now open on your browser.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
In order for us to continue we first need to enable 3 extensions. To do so we will go back to IIS Manager, select Sites >> Default >> osTicket then enter PHP Manager, select ‚ÄúEnable or Disable an extension‚Äù and enable the following: <br />
Enable: php_imap.dll <br />
Enable: php_intl.dll<br />
Enable: php_opcache.dll<br />
</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Refreshing osTicket in our browser, we should now see the following changes.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Before we continue we need to rename a file from: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-sampleconfig.php to: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php
<br />

We rename the ost-sampleconfig.php to ost-config.php
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Next we will be assigning permissions to ‚Äúost-config.php‚Äù. Begin by right clicking ost-config.php and selecting properties. After, select Security >> Advanced >> Disable Inheritance and click on remove all permissions.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Now we will click on Add >> Select a principal, type ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù, click ‚ÄúCheck Names‚Äù and click Ok. Give everyone full permissions now that we are able to do so.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Give everyone full permissions now that we are able to do so.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Afterward we can continue to setup osTicket in our web browser by clicking continue. Enter the credentials correspondingly, and use a default email to ensure you receive emails from customers who send tickets.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Before we fill out our last 3 credentials we need to download and install HeidiSQL. Once installed, open HeidiSQL and create a new session. Begin by clicking new, in User type ‚Äúroot‚Äù and in Password: ‚ÄúPassword1‚Äù, then click on open to connect to the session.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
In the session create a database called ‚ÄúosTicket‚Äù by right clicking on unnamed and selecting create new>>database. Name the database osTicket and click OK. Now we can go back to our browser and fill out the remaining credentials on the osTicket web server
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>

<p>
Enter the following:<br />
MySQL Database: osTicket <br />
MySQL Username: root<br />
MySQL Password: Password1<br />
After doing so click install.<br />
<br />

Congratulations üéâ if you followed each step correctly osTicket should now be installed with no errors!

</p>

<p>
The last thing we will be doing for this tutorial is some clean up. Go to the following path: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\setup and delete only the ‚Äúsetup‚Äù folder. Next set ‚Äúost-config.php‚Äùpermissions to ‚ÄúRead‚Äù only in C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php
